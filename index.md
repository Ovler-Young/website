Hi, Iâ€™m Chengyu Jin

Iâ€™m Chengyu Jin, a senior undergraduate student at [SUNY ESF](https://www.esf.edu/)(`State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry`), majoring in [Bioprocess Engineering](https://www.esf.edu/academics/undergraduate/bioprocess-engineering.php).

My first three years of college were spent at [BUCT](https://www.buct.edu.cn/)(`Beijing University of Chemical Technology`) as a part of the [Cooperative Program in Bioprocess Engineering](https://en-sie.buct.edu.cn/2022/0428/c2616a168115/page.htm). This program provided me with a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of bioprocess engineering.

I transferred to ESF in 2024 and am currently studying and living in Syracuse, NY.

I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to research and am looking forward to contributing to innovative projects in the field.
